When Welsh for those of you that I have not met I wanted to before we jump in let you know that we are going to be recording today’s session you’ll actually hear Notification and process there you go also we um we’ll have time later in the call to address Q&A so if you have questions please use the zoom Q&A feature to submit those questions so with that to kick us off I am very excited that we have leaders from all four of our businesses today we are very excited to continue to offer this opportunity to each of you to kick us off I have Kristen startup from consulting and Marie Columbus from tax so Kristen I will hand it to you thank you Caitlin and welcome everyone I am thrilled to be here today this is one of my favorite sessions of the year as Caitlin mentioned I am Christian startup I am a principal in our consulting practice in human capital and I have the privilege of leading the cross Consulting Group as well as chairing the junior talent committee and consulting I’m so thrilled that you’ve chaired you’ve decided to join us today and I’m excited to share with you about what the Deloitte excellent fellowship opportunity is all about the fellowship really provides A distinctive experience for our practitioners to work on challenging issues that are facing our firm and make a really meaningful impact to Deloitte and to really help shape the future of our firm at such an early stage in your career Deloitte is a large and multifaceted partnership so the high priority projects are complex and really similar to client work we’re Deloitte who’s your clients this offers fellows the chance to utilize and grow their existing skills and develop exceptional skills it’s really an exciting opportunity and I’m thrilled that you’re considering the chance could be a part of the fellowship by joining us on this journey and being a part of the the session today with that I’m going to hand it to Marie to introduce herself and say hello as well thanks Kristen and hi everybody I’m Marie combest I’m our chief of staff for our chief talent officer and this fiscal year it’s Pam downs and as we head into fiscal year 24 with all of our changes within our tax leadership one thing that we are more than excited to continue is our third year as participating in this fellowship it’s really as you heard from Kristen and Galen say a really awesome unique opportunity for our professionals and it provides a very structured rotation for our practitioners that gives them very broad exposure to our firm so you get to see some of these projects as Kristen indicated that you may not have had any exposure to before and in addition to that you get to stay and continue on your current career path which is a really big deal because we’re excited to bring you back into the business from your rotation with your enhanced skill set and your enhanced network so it’s a win win for the firm and a win for you as well so with that I’m going to turn it over to Galen who’s gonna give you all the details back to you thank you thank you Kristen and Marie so let’s cover the agenda so you have an idea of what we plan on covering today I’m going to give a program overview we have six fellows who joined us we are changing things up a little bit this year historically we’ve had one alumni and five current fellows but we decided as the alumni network continues to grow and we have alumni who can speak to going through the program and being back in client service that there’s value in changing up that mix a bit so we have 3 alumni and three current fellows who will talk about the programming as well as do some project spotlights Gretchen will cover how to apply and resources and like I mentioned earlier we will leave time for Q&A at the end so with that let’s jump in and talk about the fellowship the delayed excellence fellowship is 12 month rotation for those practitioners who have sustained high performance through the project and the programming you will get exposure to the firm and professional development experience as well I know that Kristen mentioned this but really think about this as your opportunity to consult for Deloitte during the fellowship you will have the opportunity to work on two unique projects both 6 month rotations and also we have quite a bit of structured leadership development it is full time so you are dedicated and focused on the fellowship and the fifth start class which this call is focused on will start September 11th in addition to leadership exposure on projects we have what we call leadership learnings you’re put into a cohort and I know the fellows will talk about this being one of the highlights for them which really helps you now that we have fellows from all four businesses build your green dot network very early in your career we have quite a few different trainings from governing bodies and governing processes to finance 101 and we also have the leadership toolkit not going to go into too much detail because the fellows probably are already feeling like I’m stealing some of their Thunder that they will definitely cover the the program in a little bit more detail I want to give you just a sample project but like I mentioned each fellow will talk about their projects as well we had a fellow who was connected to that LCSP mentorship program if that term LSP is using client service partner wow I just went blank it’s LCSP is lead client service partner and the fellow got to be connected to standing up a mentorship program the idea behind it is connecting a new LCSP to a tenured LCSP to really help accelerate their transition it’s a one year program where you know they’re investing in the new LCSP’s giving them guidance and helping build lasting connections so you can see a connection there on many of your engagements there is an LCSP and so the exposure that that the fellow got on that project they were able to take those skills those experiences back to their client service role I want to touch on performance management you will keep your home practice coach it’s very intentional it’s helping keep your connection back to your home practice Gretchen and I are very closely connected with both your home practice coaches as well as your home practice and are closely aligned through the mid year and year ends process Marie mentioned that you stay on your career trajectory and just think of the fellowship as part of your story you will still attend milestone trainings and events tied to your home practice and we highly recommend if you’re connected to a firm initiative in your home practice that you stay connected there as well I am sure every fellow will vouch for this a year may sound like a long time but it goes so quickly so staying connected to those firm initiatives keeping your home practice coach really helps with your reintegration back into to client service before I hand it off to the fellows if you haven’t already spent some time on the dnet site we do have quite a few we’ve built them out extensively this year based on questions we’ve received so would recommend that you review the FAQ’s and we also enhance the 12 month journey map that just outlines a potential fellows experience in the program so with that we’re going to hand it off to fellows in addition to what you had planned on covering I would just ask maybe if you fellows want to talk about why you applied or what your favorite parts of the fellowship was and or is that would be great so I’ll hand it to you Erica awesome hi everyone my name is Erica Anderson and I am part of the fourth current start class I’ve been with the firm for about three years two years prior to the fellowship and my home practice is in S and ACG consulting and I’m based out of New York I joined the fellowship because after two years of client work primarily within FBI strategy I wanted to try something new twist it around and put my efforts within Deloitte and learn the business from a green dot lens and my favorite part of the fellowship is the project work I’m currently on Deloitte’s office for the future which has been a ton of fun and also the leadership presentations which is why I’m excited to tell you a little bit more about our guest speakers in the fellowship we have access and exposure to executive Deloitte leaders with monthly guest speakers discussion topics vary greatly there’s something for everybody the four-star class has heard from queasy Mitchell our chief purpose officer Jen Fisher our chief well-being officer Doug Baldwin our former CIO and new chief clients and markets officer to name a few and we’re getting to hear from Dan helfrich our consulting CEO within the next two weeks so there truly is something for everybody but the fellowship includes more layers than just guest speakers and I’m going to pass it to Britt to talk a little bit more about the cohort experience thanks Erica and make sure I’m not double needed here so hey everyone I’m Brett I am a consultant based out of our Boston office I’ve been with Deloitte for just about 4 ½ years now so I was with and I was part of the third start class so I am an alum of the fellowship so happy to touch on anything in terms of coming back into client service as well yeah so I just wanted to talk a little bit about why I decided to do the fellowship so I kind of started to feel a little bit stagnant and very safe in my consulting bubble if you will and I felt really comfortable with what I was doing and kind of wanted to push myself outside of my comfort zone and really explore everything that Deloitte had to offer just because having that type of green dot mentality and being able to explore all four businesses and how they collectively work together with something I was really interested in so excited to join the fellowship and I’m very grateful for it I want to talk about the cohort experience as it was one of my favorite parts of the fellowship so you are grouped into your cohorts and their balance based off of the type of businesses and work that you’ve done and have that in previously so it was a really great opportunity to connect with people based out of advisory and tax and audit where I quite honestly did not have a lot of experience there and wasn’t sure exactly with the type of work that they did so it was great to connect with them on a professional level and to be able to talk to them about different projects the guest speakers that we got to hear then go through our learning and development throughout the 12 months but even beyond that it was a great experience to connect with everybody on a personal level so we still connect on a monthly basis even as long so we just heard we have a wedding coming up we have a baby bus coming due so it’s very exciting to have that type of professional and personal connection fellowship I’m going to pass it on to Trevor now to talk about our leadership and development awesome thanks Britt hello everyone my name is Trevor Clark I’ve been with Deloitte for four years I’m out of the Roslyn office I’m aligned to consulting strategy and analytics and specifically artificial intelligence and data I’m going to be talking to you guys today around leadership and development I’m in the Deloitte excellence fellowship there is a variety of different opportunities to hone in into your leadership skills not only through cohort presentations but also the leadership toolkit series what I’ve learned most during that series is that there are spaces for individuals who look like me who are very outspoken and very passionate about their work here at the lake so that has gained my confidence as a practitioner here at Deloitte I joined the fellowship because I’m just to be honest I was looking for ways to not only keep my resume fresh but I was looking for ways to differentiate myself from my peers and this is something as everyone has mentioned before you’re able to work on a lot of high impact projects and the fellowship and my favorite part of this fellowship is the experience that specifically my second rotation I’ve been working with talent acquisition and so I’ve been able to understand the different ways Deloitte not only recruits diverse talent but the different ways that diluted Deloitte is sourcing different talent in different ways so this has been a great experience and again if you all have any questions please feel free to reach out to me so with that being said I’ll hand it off to our fellows who are going to be talking about their specific project experiences awesome thanks everyone hi my name is Eric samuda I’m a senior consultant out of the Detroit office and I was part of the first start class so I was a fellow back in 2020 so it’s absolutely awesome to see the number of people on the call as well as well you know the second third fourth and soon to be fifth start class so I’m going to go into a little bit about you know project I had within PPMD talent but to start I’ll say the reason I joined the fellowship was similar to to what you’ve heard but I had an opportunity to serve in internally a little bit before and I was always fascinated about what makes a firm of this size kind of tick on the inside we’re able to serve clients you know externally through these four functions but how how do we support that how do we support Deloitte internally so I was drawn to apply and then from there I’m so thankful to have been chosen I’d say my favorite part besides you know my cohort was really you know the support you get from leadership particularly Galen and team within this fellowship I’ve been with the firm six years now which is crazy to say and I can unequivocally say this has been probably the highlight as much as I love serving clients and have loved you know each part of my the right journey the last six years this you know has been and I think will forever be if not the highlight one of the many highlights at at toy so I’ll be brief but my project was in the PMD succession strategy so our partners and principals have a talent org or a talent just to support them that is separate than talent as we all know as non partner and so this project was you know how do we make sure that our succession which is when we’re naming leaders would that be LCSP market leaders strategy and analytics leaders health plan leaders are we thinking about the next leaders down line to make sure that our leaders are talented to make sure they’re representative of our people and to make sure you know we’re never in a position where we’re not have a strong robust pipeline of leaders so I would can say it was very interesting got to see a little bit what the inside of the the partner world is like in terms of talent promotions as well as leadership and skills that to what is looking for so it’s helped me become a better leader within the firm and outside of the firm and as some of the others said I’m in I’m in alumni which means I went back and declined service and have been back in the client service now for for three years so it’s incredibly smooth transition and thank you for joining and I’ll pass it along to Stephanie to talk about you know a different project thanks Eric how everyone my name is Stephanie Sam I’m a current fellow and I’ve been at Deloitte for almost four years now my home practice is advisory and prior to the fellowship I’ve spent most of my time working on Sarbanes-Oxley socks internal audit projects within the TMT space in the Bay Area and one of the reasons why I joined the fellowship was to gain a more holistic comprehensive understanding of the firm and to better understand how the enabling areas work together with the businesses to drive firm growth and make the firm what it is today and I’m excited to share a little bit about one of the projects that I’ve worked on as part of my first rotation in the fellowship I had the pleasure of spending six months with our executive accelerators program within client and market growth working on executive transition labs and these executive transition labs are immersive full day experiences where we help our C-Suite clients transition into their new role successfully so we spend the day with our C-Suite clients discussing their aspirations time talent relationships and priorities and at the end of the lab we create a 180 day plan for the executive and so my team was responsible for conducting stakeholder interviews working with LCSP’s and PMD’s to plan the lab and also deliver the lab day of I actually delivered a lab for an executive for a client that I served prior to the fellowship and if I wasn’t in the fellowship I probably wouldn’t have had the opportunity to be a part of that lab and contribute day out and so as a really great way for me to broaden my understanding of the client I served and also work with leaders outside my home practice in advisory and overall this project was a really meaningful experience for me it taught me about the importance of executive presence the value of building trust with clients and I also learned how Deloitte really invests in builds relationships with our client so really grateful to have been able to work on labs because of this fellowship and I’ll pass it over to Cam to talk about his project in BGS hey everyone my name is camp Copeland I’m a senior consultant with our advisory practice over GPS and I’ve been with the firm about four years now I was part of our third fellowship class I almost applied to the 4th class but I figured it was time for me to get back to client service but I just loved it so much in terms of what I was doing before the fellowship I served on one of our Department of Justice clients and I love that project it was really great but I got the sense that I wasn’t seeing the bigger picture our team was focused on very specific processes and I wanted to get a better sense of how delete operates not just on specific projects but really across businesses across industries and even on a global scale so I really wanted to get that peek behind the curtains and see what actually made U the green dot and how does that green dot actually work so for my first rotation I got to help out with the shared agenda PMO team over in VGS now for those of you who are unfamiliar with shared agenda it is sort of like the the Nexus of firm strategy So you have different topics different strategic pillars that the firm has invested in think DI tech globalizing the firm future of work all of these topics sort of converge under one umbrella and that’s the space that we we sort of operated in so in terms of my role in this the shared agenda space we got to work with senior leaders and stakeholders from across these different strategic topics that sort of report out progress that they’ve made throughout the year and then ultimately bundle all of that knowledge up for materials that we ultimately sent to to Joe you and the board which was it was really cool I think that just being in the fellowship in general this project and the second project gave me exactly what I wanted when I when I thought about joining the fellowship in the first place is sort of like stepping into a hot air balloon where the more experience that you get in the fellowship the higher you rise in terms of just being able to see the bigger picture of Deloitte see how the green dot operates across businesses and sort of connects behind the scenes so that the more integrated going forward so with that the fellowship I could not recommend it highly highly enough but I’m going to pass it over to Gretchen to talk about the application process great thanks so much Cam hello and welcome I’m Gretchen Reed I’m the program and operations manager for the fellowship and I’m going to be talking about eligibility and the application process so first eligibility so outlined here there’s several criteria first being is it’s open to all US based professionals for the history of sustained hyperformance who possessed A variety of consultative skills and those are actually listed on our denat site so you can find that list there additionally applicants need two or more years of relevant client experience and at least one year 10 year at Deloitte a little more on job eligibility the business of the fellowship and the business leadership for each of the four businesses that you’re hearing from today we’re very intentional in looking at the ideal time for practitioners to do this this fellowship and to make sure that it’s the right time for them to have the appropriate technical skills before doing a rotational program like this so getting into some of the specifics by business the first one is audit and insurance eligibility of seniors starting their second year consulting is for consultants and senior consultants risk and financial advisory consultants and senior consultants impact the seniors starting their second year additionally for eligibility it is for all those in the traditional talent model and as mentioned above that it is for practitioners with the same high performance and we work closely with your home business leadership and talent to confirm that high performance and then well one note actually on this with the timing this year and I know just green light conversations and such that the promotion eligibility for those that are being promoted this next month in June to one of those eligible level levels we do encourage you to you know apply that this is applicable to that new level and that you have all right OK now moving on to the second part of the application you could find the application on our dnet site and a big part of the the application is the PowerPoint slides and so wanted to pause and just say a few words about those PowerPoint slides one is PowerPoint is often a key component of fellowship roles so that there’s an opportunity or not only to demonstrate your PowerPoint skills but then certainly you know demonstrate that while answering the question and really looking to answer the question on why you want to be part of the program you wrote really sets you apart in your application next the application is selection process takes place over several months applications are due no later than 5:00 PM June 9th that date might sound familiar we realize that that is impact day and so we ask that you to please plan accordingly to make sure that your application is in by that deadline of candidates will be provided by the business and by the fellowship leadership and we’ll be contacting you for if you proceed into the interviews in July and then leadership will make final decisions and communicate those decisions by mid August and that next class this fifth start class would then be starting Monday September 11th and that week is a full week of required and exciting onboarding all right I think I’ve covered that slide moving on to some additional resources to support you as you look to see if the fellowship is the right program for you to pursue and to support you through the application process as mentioned to the donut site has a lot of information I feel like I’ve been saying a lot but it is very robust with FAQ it also has the deadlines announcements quotes from current and fellow that are current and past fellows business leaders and such and again I think we’ve we’ve pointed a lot of people to the FAQ’s there and eligibility and the application link if there’s anything there after looking through the website and you don’t see answers to your questions you know feel free to send a message into our DE fellowship e-mail and one thing in addition I know it’s it’s always great to hear from our fellows and thank you the six that just shared their stories but if you want to look for other fellows to reach out to you and you have some of those questions you can find our fellows the current and the alum by going to VPN and searching Deloitte excellent fellowship it’ll pull up a list into your afraid to reach out to any of them as well with their questions or your questions rather alright and with that we are I see quite a lot of questions coming in we will be getting to those I know some of them are being answered live here but before we get to that feel free to keep your questions coming there but I will be handing it over to Justin silver from risk and financial advisory and shira from audit and assurance to share their perspectives as well great thanks Gretchen and and uh welcome everybody as Gretchen said my name is Justin silver I lead one of our operating units in risk and financial advisory and really that’s where we we manage a lot of the talent of the business so got involved doing the program couple of years ago right right at the start or right after it started and you know I would say it’s been an excellent program for our people fantastic opportunity and you know I think the biggest thing is is you’ve heard you’re working on some of the most strategic projects for the firm and even as a PMD you know I look for opportunities to get involved with those projects so to be able to get involved early on in your career I think is is an excellent opportunity you know I think as it was said earlier you’re consulting for Deloitte and and that’s a big opportunity they they’re your client and you’re getting exposure to senior executives understanding how the business works so from advisories perspective we’ve certainly have a positive experience you know the feedback has been positive you heard from Stephanie and Kam earlier on their experiences they’re they’re both from risk and financial advisory so you know we remain you know very bullish on the program think it’s a great opportunity and pretty seamless to come back into the business after you’ve done it so with that sure I’ll turn it to you great thank you Justin and as mentioned my name is Sheila wood and I’m a senior manager in talent and I work with the audit and assurance practice and we are also very excited to be able to offer the fellowship as an opportunity for our professionals this will be our third year participation and we’re very excited we get to continue because similar feedback from our fellows in the audit and assurance practice just such a unique opportunity you’re able to really develop your leadership skills and so for those of you that are looking for an experience that will allow you to get insight into the inner workings of the firm as well as to continue and hone your consultative skills that are important to your growth this is a great opportunity for you and we are certainly supportive and looking forward to more A and a participants in the fellowship in this coming year and then coming back to our A and a practice to help us enhance what we’re already doing with your new knowledge and skills so we can’t wait to see who applies kaylin I think we’re ready to hand back to you perfect thank you Justin and shira before we jump into Q&A just wanted to share and I think you’ve probably heard it plenty of time plenty of times but highly recommend going out to the denut site a lot of information deadlines announcements that journey map that I referenced we’ll also be sharing the video of today’s recording in the coming days and also any updates there is an update portion of the D net site as well application link etc and as Gretchen mentioned we do have the fellowship mailbox if your question isn’t answered today feel free to to reach out to that mailbox so with that we will move to the Q&A portion I think to start we have maybe two questions for alums Eric you wanna jump in and then Cam yeah hi everyone this is Eric as I mentioned before part of the first start class and so I think one of the questions how do you keep connected with your home base while on the fellowship and then do you feel it’s difficult to get staffed on a client project coming back so I’ll answer the first part I’d say both are are very simple so connected with your home base I would say I think keeping that coach and maintaining those regular connections is key as well as kind of what we always do at devoid just maintaining your network and maintaining those connections so would that be monthly calls or just checking in with your previous teams I felt it was very very easy all my previous teams our previous managers senior managers coach were super supportive because they know how great of an opportunity this is was for myself and and for any of the practitioners that work for them to all very supportive and and was very very simple and even my peers you know my peers were probably most interested in what I was doing so staying connected to them within my home practice you know what’s awesome and and seamless and second part about getting staffed so I I might have failed to mention this but I said within strategy I’m I’m a senior consultant now but when I came back I was a consultant and staffing is I would say you know just as easy as is in between projects I think the huge value is when you help maintain that current network during the fellowship and obviously fellowship is choosing all of you where the potential fellows are previous because of high performance your home practice will will miss you they they want you back and they want you back and serving clients and and back on their teams because they appreciate the good work you did prior to the fellowship so Caitlin and team keep a close watch with your home practice as well as your resource managers and your talent leads within whatever offering portfolio you sent in to make sure you’re integrated right back and I think the you know probably another additional part of the fellowship is that what you’ve learned within the fellowship you’re able to then even serve clients more effectively and efficiently due to the you know insights game giant so perfect thank you Eric Kim I’m going to jump in there’s a question that I’ll answer and then I’ll hand it to you but there’s a question about pursuing certifications while in the fellowship we’ve had and Gretchen feel free to chime in as well but we’ve had folks pursue sisa sisa some PMO certification this app and what I would say there is the answer the short answer is yes but that you need to stay connected to your coach your home practice and we will want to confirm that that’s something that you a certification you’re planning on pursuing and your coach is supportive of that and your home practice but yes you can pursue those per the established eligibility requirements depending on the program all right Cam I’ll hand it to you a question about the projects you’ve worked on yeah absolutely and before I get to that question just piggybacking on what Eric said the I guess the experience that you bring coming from the fellowship back to client service is invaluable and it is true I mean it’s really unique you get to see the firm I completely different scale than most folks at your peer level have been able to see it so I just cannot stress that enough at the Garrick absolutely nailed nailed it so the question I’m addressing we’re all my projects specifically GPS during my fellowship since I come from GPS no so and I think that the fellowship is very deliberate in making sure the projects are available are spread across all of the different enabling areas and that they are sort of high priority strategic initiatives instead of just focusing on a specific industry or specific place and again alluding back to what Eric was saying since that breadth of experience is so wide you get to see so many things and also you get to connect with so many fellows doing different things as well even if you’re not specifically on those projects you still learn a lot it is hugely comprehensive and understanding the firm and and making sure that you are growing along with your other fellows sharing this knowledge when you come back to your home industry so Galen I’ll pass it back off to you perfect thank you we it looks like some questions around how the fellows are aligned to projects a few pieces one once accepted into the fellowship we have an interest survey I guess I I’m pretty sure we probably have a more specific title than that but essentially we have each fellow give us input on their interest their skills where they want to be connected and where they want to get exposure while in the fellowship and then we go through on our end II would tell you that that is put into a model um that helps match your skill set your interest with the projects that we have aligned for each rotation so yes you have an opportunity to provide Input but we actually do the matching to each of the projects OK Gretchen it looks as though there’s a lot of questions around promotions do you want to answer that and then I’ll chime in yeah that sounds great OK so the questions around promotions and we’ll basically I know you you touched on this a little bit I think Galen but you know basically staying on your current career trajectory and that may include as you see our eligibility it could be a promotion year and so to that the fellowship will be a component of you’re your career journey we have had fellows quite a lot of them promoted while in the fellowship so definitely see that across you know the businesses when eligible when you’re going up for promotion to manager or any of them but one we do point out for manager is to make sure you connect with your coach and your practice leader just to make sure that you understand the development areas to make sure that you have all those from your home practice perspective often those are more of the technical skills and such just to make sure that you’re making sure those are all under your belt basically before joining the fellowship which is another great opportunity so that that just about is just make sure you’re talking about it with your coach and your talent business advisor as well agreed thanks Gretchen all right Erica hardest we got a question about what was most challenging during your time in the fellowship and that might be one of the hardest questions but in terms of what has been most challenging I would say I’m coming from FSI strategy consulting for two years and so I think you’re taught a certain way to just conduct your day-to-day you know what good looks like and then within each of these projects you shift and you learn how to interact with people differently you are engaged with dramatically different type of work and for example I’m currently right now on working with the office for the future which is developing 5 to 10 year plans around how delete world approached different industries it’s big picture thinking it’s futuristic thinking dystopian thinking whatever you want to call it but I think one of the most challenging things is changing your mindset and thinking big picture but at the same time I think I’m going to come back with the competitive edge having met that hopefully thanks Erica wait to field the hard question a question around utilization being tracked and how that impacts what’s going on in the economy etcetera I as far as the utilization piece we actually have set up a WBS that allows you to track your hours while on the fellowship and then report on adjusted utilization how that is handled does vary a little bit by business I know some folks depending on what business you’re in can see that adjusted udle right in your dashboard other businesses that’s not the case but we do work closely with your TBA is and talent team to be able to pull that adjusted Udall so there is still that metric and the ability to to track and report on utilization Gretchen anything you would add there I think I captured the big items you know essentially there’s you know slightly different mechanisms for doing that but essentially your hours in the fellowship are accounted for utilization got it OK let’s see I could take one that I think we’ve gotten in a couple of different ways around what really makes a good candidate for the fellowship I know we’ve talked about that throughout the call in different ways but I’m happy to provide a little bit of a summary kind of from my perspective as well not my perspective kind of consolidating a lot of what we’ve heard today first certainly reviewing the eligibility and I know there’s a few layers to that but of eligible criteria one thing that I really see that sets the candidates apart that are most successful in for an opportunity so unique like this is one certainly what I highlighted in the eligibility piece around consultative skills so again please do look at that list on our denet site but then also really a desire to expand your network and understand how Deloitte works from that podium balloon of cams and that desire to be curious and passion to like team building coming together with colleagues that you’ve never worked with before from across the businesses That that really being a place that excites you and also that ability to have agility and ability to adapt to ambiguity I think that’s a big piece to it and kind of saying a different way is being comfortable to some degree being uncomfortable and really leaning into that kind of space to understand and navigate it just wanted to provide a little bit more color I throw those questions coming in around you know strong candidates or ones that we’ve seen really kind of embrace this type of opportunity perfect thank you Gretchen Trevor I think we have a question for you yes so there is a question in the chat um that said what was the most valuable lesson that you learned during your time in the fellowship and I would say the idea of you hear all the time with Deloitte that to be here you have to have an entrepreneurial spirit and in the fellowship you really learn that and you really learn that you know you are kind of in control for your career here and the fellowship just kind of just gives you the tools to kind of try to be your best self and so here I’ve learned to you know just always advocate for yourself always advocate for the things that you want within your career and the as I said before the fellowship gives you the tools to actually do that just one reminder I know we’re seeing a lot of questions come in and somewhere around eligibility and timing and project assignments and just want to again point people also to the FAQ’s first and please do send us a message if you don’t find your answers there but we are trying to work through all of these various questions so thank you sorry I think you probably lost me for a moment oh can you hear me now we can yeah OK I almost made it through an hour without a technology without technology issues the 9/11 date is a set date that week of onboarding we have leaders from each of the enabling areas there is quite a bit of very intentional time around getting to know your cohort and really teeing you up for success in the program so that 911 date is set in stone um again realize for those that we extend offers to we are working closely throughout the process both with your leaders your talent leaders and then down the line with the resource managers and your project teams OK let’s just see how are we doing on answering OK it looks like there’s a question about coming as a consultant from as and a mean we have folks on the call fellows today from S&A so Trevor Erica have you felt that coming from S and A’s been a hindrance well the microphone only acknowledges you I see you both shaking your heads but nobody else can see you shaking your heads unless you talk so you actually have to answer just one of you want to answer happy start and I’ll pass it to Trevor so you can add on to that absolutely not I think in SA think we’re trained to think and have that entrepreneurial spirit that Trevor was mentioning before and I think this program takes it to the next level so I think you’re in a really good position to start this program yeah I’ll just piggyback off what Erica said I believe on many of the projects if you’re from S&A there are opportunities to deal with data in some form as I said before if you just added a cake for yourself and say hey this is my skill set and my experience and a lot of you know other that I know they wanted to deal with data their project managers were able to find them something to to kind of work on that skill set so yeah no it’s you’ve been you you’re able to kind of sharpen those S&A skills here so don’t worry perfect thank you I think it’s funny that you both shook your head yes but everyone couldn’t see that thank you for chiming in all right we did cover project matching just looking at other questions coming in I know you covered this at the beginning but in case anyone joined late too that the recording will be posted on the DNA site so that’s where you’ll be able to find it in the next couple days there’s a question about applying during your third year as a senior so just based on that question I’m thinking it’s likely coming from a practitioner from A&A or from tax and my recommendation we do have folks from each of those businesses in their third year but my recommendation would be to reach out to your coach have those discussions around um the experience you need the skill sets technical skill sets that Gretchen mentioned and making sure that you are set up for success coming back into client service I don’t know Marie or shira if you have anything that you want to add to that he said that perfectly for audit OK perfect it’s almost like we’ve been working together for you right everybody’s situation is a little bit different and your coach would absolutely no best or if not at least in tax with your coach and the discussion with your lead business advisor obviously they’re very familiar with this program and as Galen said we’ve had practitioners participate for the past two years so we can definitely provide you with some additional insight as to what’s the right timing for you perfect question about the next class size we are looking for our fifth start class to have around 50 practitioners and just for reference the four start class had 43 so still continuing to grow the fellowship sun question around travel I will tell you that it really varies project to project we are seeing a lot more travel in the last class of fellows but again it really varies by project part of that survey that I mentioned that we leverage around matching you to projects there is a question in there around travel yes I want to travel no I don’t want to travel yes please sign me up for a project that has travel so you do have that opportunity to weigh in and that will be factored into as well how you’re matched to projects but it is not it’s interesting I used to say generally the enabling areas work more remotely from home but again we’re seeing a little bit more trouble for or not even a little bit quite a bit more travel but again we’ll vary project to project OK I can weigh and there’s a question about speaking to how does the fellowship help me within my own home practice and and I’m thinking that’s tied to when you return to your home practice so I’ll chime in but also happy to have any of the fellows that are alums chime in as well I think a piece that I hear overall at the end of the fellowship as the fellows present to their home practice is this broader one we’ve touched on right the broader understanding of the firm but even more than that as said you have sustained top or high performance you’ve been doing an amazing job on your client service work but this new sense of looking at a client project holistically not just this is my deliverable and this is what I’m working on but that ability to step back understand why are we doing this project how does my work fit into the broader work we’re doing at the client and it may not happen immediately but now that you have this network this green dot network across all the other businesses and you have at least a baseline understanding of what the other businesses do as part of the fellowship just so you know each of the fellows teach the others about their home practice I think oftentimes things that may not have alerted you oh we may have an opportunity here for someone in tax or this is something that I heard about from an A and a practitioner I’m just going to reach out is there a potential opportunity here or just even bringing it up to your leader I think that building your green dot network will help you from that lens as well Eric I saw you maybe you start to go off mute is there anything you would add to that no I would just echo I mean as as I can speak from a consulting POV you know we serve some of you know massive massive clients and Deloitte and massive massive organization and never you know from a project leadership standpoint are we serving those clients in a silo it all has to do not only with how other Deloitte functions are serving them but how their organizations are operating at large so by better understanding our organization and how the dependencies across green dot or just even across different types of the enabling areas I think better equip me to serve you know these large clients that from a consulting perspective serves and in addition the longer you have hopes and aspirations of staying with the firm the more critical knowledge of the firm and how it works is imperative whether you have hopes of being a manager senior manager or PMD and you need that Deloitte knowledge to really stand out and and make the most of your career so perfect thank you Eric there’s a question what does a day in the life of a fellow look like happy to have it any of the fellows if they want to chime in I know that the answer really will vary based on the project that you’re on but I do think there’s some overlap whether it’s the cohorts the initiatives you’re connected to the fellowship called leadership learnings the toolkit so any fellows want to chime in maybe a current fellow yeah and I’m happy to chime in on this one I can share a little I know I shared a little bit earlier about the my experience and the executive transition lives and I’m happy to just kind of give you what a day in the life of that looks like so if I was staffing the lab probably I would be doing some sort of like lab prep work whether that’s stakeholder interviews for a meeting with LCSP PPMD the account team members just to understand the nature of the account and kind of the executive that we’re preparing the lab for perhaps run through a couple modules of what we’ll do last day and prep for the lab and then that’s kind of the the fellowship project side of my day and then I may be on a call with my cohort just to build connections and hear about the projects they’re working on or participating in a leadership tool toolkit series called it’s a toolkit that Galen had developed and it walks you through kind of like 6 modules of really what it means to be a purpose driven leader and then um on lab day what that looks like is all spent eight hours in a lot with the executive with my team prepping and facilitating the lab and then after that we’ll spend some time kind of digesting the lab day and then working towards a post lab deliverable to send over to the client perfect thank you Stephanie OK trying to manage the clock there is some questions around or specific questions by business so if you are hoping to connect with a fellow that is from your home practice again I think gretchen’s the one who mentioned it but if you go out to DPN our current and alums fellows all have the de fellowship badge which makes searching them very easy so would recommends if you want to connect with someone from your home practice to get their thoughts and be please take the time to review the
